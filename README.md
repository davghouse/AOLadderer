Implant laddering tool for the sci-fi MMORPG Anarchy Online.

Background
----------

Characters in Anarchy Online (AO) have six abilities and many different skills.  
The abilities are:  

| Strength      |  Agility          |
| :--------     | :------------     |
| **Stamina**   | **Intelligence**  |
| **Sense**     | **Psychic**       |

Implants are items that require one of the six abilities and a skill called Treatment to equip.   
Implants have a Quality Level (QL), which determines the amount of ability and Treatment required.  
There are 13 slots on a character where implants of the corresponding type can be equipped:    

| Eye             | Head      | Ear            |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| **Right-Arm**   | **Chest** | **Left-Arm**   |
| **Right-Wrist** | **Waist** | **Left-Wrist** |
| **Right-Hand**  | **Leg**   | **Left-Hand**  |
|                 | **Feet**  |                |

Implants are useful because they can contain Nano Clusters.  
Talking about an implant usually means talking about a cluster specification, with no QL specified.  
Clusters provide beneficial modifications; the higher the implant QL, the greater the benefits.  
Implants have three slots for clusters, which can contain at most one cluster of the corresponding type:  

| Shining | Bright | Faded |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |

Each type of implant has a set of Shining, a set of Bright, and a set of Faded clusters available to it.  
Across all 13 Shining sets, a cluster for each skill and each ability occurs exactly once.    
This is true for the 13 Bright and 13 Faded sets as well.  
Example implants:  

| Type | QL  | Ability Req., Val. | Treatment Req. | Shining, Val.  | Bright, Val.    | Faded, Val.  |
| ---- | --- | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Feet | 1   | Agility, 6         | 11             | Concealment, 6 | Martial Arts, 3 | Duck-Exp, 2  |
| Head | 200 | Intelligence, 404  | 951            | Chemistry, 105 | Nano Pool, 63   | Tutoring, 42 |

Equivalent representation of the above implants:  

| QL  | Shining     | Bright       | Faded    |
| --- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 1   | Concealment | Martial Arts | Duck-Exp |
| 200 | Chemistry   | Nano Pool    | Tutoring |

**Implant laddering** is the process of using implants (and other items) to equip higher QL implants.  
Neither of the implants above is useful for laddering, since neither adds to any abilities or Treatment.  
The following ladder implants might be useful in a laddering process:  

| Type  | QL  | Ability Req. | Shining   | Bright    | Faded    |
| ----- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Chest | ?   | Psychic      | Sense     | Psychic   | Strength |
| Head  | ?   | Intelligence | Treatment | Nano Pool | Sense    |

Perhaps the Head implant would be equipped to allow a character with surplus Psychic to equip a higher QL of the Chest.
Both together might allow for equipping a higher QL of some Sense-requiring implant desired by the character.  

  
**Twinking** is the process of equipping a character with hard-to-equip and/or hard-to-get items.  
For many characters, laddering implants is a part of this process.  

Usage
-----

For Windows 7 or 8 users, download the latest release, unzip, and double-click on Ladderer.exe.  

Choose your implant configuration and input the abilities and Treatment you'll have at the time of equipping.
I do this by having an actual character and equipping it with gear I think will be good for implant laddering.
Make sure there are no important implant slots full; it's assumed all slots are empty, but R/L-Wrist and L-Hand don't matter.
There are options to cast buffs on yourself if you don't want to get them in-game beforehand. Be careful not to double-count.
Then press build and follow the steps from there. Don't remove ladder implants until absolutely necessary.

Usefulness
----------

Comparing implant configurations for a level 48 froob Nano-Technician:  

| Strategy     | Average QL | Link                                       | Matter Crea |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Twink        | 140.46     | http://auno.org/ao/equip.php?saveid=192647 | 147         |
| Tool         | 134.54     | http://auno.org/ao/equip.php?saveid=192648 | 145         |
| Direct       | 125.00     | http://auno.org/ao/equip.php?saveid=192649 | 138         |
| Tool + extra | 135.39     | http://auno.org/ao/equip.php?saveid=192650 | 145         |  

The first strategy was done by hand, twinking naturally. The second uses the tool.
The third uses no ladder implants, just equipping required implants in the order which maximizes the average QL.
The last strategy modifies the tool in a simple way, but uses many more laddering implants.
It always performs better, but in practice the gains aren't worth the extra laddering implants.  
   
This tool provides a decent approximation for people wanting to equip a low to mid-level character.
At this stage in development I won't use the tool for full-blown twinks, but perhaps some will.

**Good things:**  
* Just one of each type of laddering implant can be used
* As a result, no more than 10 laddering implants will be used
* No more than 23 implant insertions
* No more than 10 implant removals
* Two simply-described, simply-presented steps; equipping, and reverse-removal
  
**Bad things:** 
* Knows nothing about non-implant equipment (main reason for lower average QL)
* Knows nothing about perks
* Maximizes over average QL, but some implants matter more and some less
* Requires implants of exact QLs, which is an annoying process and an infeasible one for some players
* Getting implants of exact QLs might be annoying enough to just go ahead and twink naturally


Algorithm
---------

There's a base solver to find the ordering over a set of type-distinct implants that maximizes their average QL.
Such a set of implants has no more than 10 ladder implants, if every slot that can contain a ladder implant does.
To find the ordering it looks at every possible ordering of all the ladder implants in the set (10! = 3,628,800).  
  
The algorithm uses this solver. Each step in the algorithm chooses the next ladder implant to equip.
This is done by considering each unoccupied laddering slot in turn. Each slot has a set of laddering implants
available to it. This set is broken down into subsets, where implants within the same subset differ
in their required ability, but modify the abilities and Treatment in the same way. From each subset the best implant
(the one requiring the ability we have the most of) is inserted, and tested. Testing runs the base solver on
the remaining required implants, and then removes in reverse the ladder implants, inserting a required implant
after each removal. The implant yielding the highest average QL is chosen and locked in, and the next step proceeds.
The algorithm stops when no more laddering slots are available, or when the average QL from one step to the next 
doesn't increase.  

Fortunately, there aren't many laddering implants. There are 33 subsets, with implants equal (from a laddering perspective)
up to their required ability. There are 63 total laddering implants considered by the algorithm. 
Some ladder implants aren't included -- if their cluster specification is a subset of another's and they require the same ability.
